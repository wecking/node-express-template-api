## Password Retrieval

To enable the password retrieval feature it is recommended that you create environment variables for your credentials instead of hard coding them into the [email dispatcher module](https://github.com/wecking/node-express-template-api/blob/master/modules/account-module/email-dispatcher.js).

To do this on OSX you can simply add them to your .profile or .bashrc file.

	export NL_EMAIL_HOST='smtp.gmail.com'
	export NL_EMAIL_USER='your.email@gmail.com'
	export NL_EMAIL_PASS='1234'
